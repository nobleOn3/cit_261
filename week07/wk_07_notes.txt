Notes for Week 07, talking about functions and AJAX requests.

IIFE (pronounced 'iffy')
--------------------------------------------------
Is a function that is called right after it is 
declared. Performed simply by placing ()
after the function declaration.

Best used if the function only needs to be fun once.
This helps keep global variables down in number,
uses similar ideas to strict mode.

Function Redefining
--------------------------------------------------
Functions can redifine themselves if it has a
variable with the same name as the function itself,
and that variable is assigned to an anonymous 
function.

Promises
---------------------------------------------------
Essentially do the same thing as a callback, but
simplify the process to reduce/avoid confusing 
code.
