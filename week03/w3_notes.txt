-----------------------------------------------------------
-DOM is split into nodes., with each tag being a node, and
each node within that node being a child of it.
-<body> (1st Node)
------<div> (2nd Node and also child of 1st Node, parent of 3rd)
------------<table> (3rd Node and child of 2nd Node)

-Each parent node has a childNode property and each child
has a parentNode property
--firstChild points to first and lastChild points to last
--previousSibling and next Sibling also are handy for moving
through children nodes
